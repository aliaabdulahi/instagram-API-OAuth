# Instagram API OAuth

In this project, I experimented with Instagram's API to create a webpage that loaded the user's photos taken at the current location they were at. 
  
## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node
  
After gaining access to an Instagram Client ID, through their API Platform, I created a page with a button that redirected the user to Instagram's login page, and after giving Instagram access to their account, they were returned to the Redirect URI webpage that would display all photographs taken at the current location they were in.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time experimenting with token-based authentication and authorization. It was very rewarding learning this because I know this is something I will use a lot more as a I continue to make web applications.

## Examples: 
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
